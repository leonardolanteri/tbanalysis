        For an array of MCP signal waveforms; where each waveform is the time and voltage of the signal. 
        This grabs the 3 smallest values (so the peak) then does a PARABOLIC INTERPOLATION to estimate the peak

        Works only if you have enough points close to the signal peak. This function does the following,

        Lets say you have 3 points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) you can create 3 equations,
        A*x1^2+B*x1+C=y1
        A*x2^2+B*x2+C=y2
        A*x3^2+B*x3+C=y3

        And then this is a matrix eq of form M*c = b,
        [x1^2 x1 1] [A]   [y1]
        |x2^2 x2 1| |B| = |y2|
        [x3^2 x3 1] [C]   [y3]

        To solve for A, B, C you can solve by doing c = M^-1 * b

        This function does this columnary for n waveforms where each waveform needs to have an interpolated peak.
